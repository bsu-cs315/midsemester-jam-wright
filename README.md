### Reflection
I tried to contain the "spirit" of a game jam in the week's process, particularly mimicking my
actions during last year's Global Game Jam. I spent less than an hour writing out concepts,
settled on one, and drew a small mockup. I found I wasn't able to restrict myself in regards to time,
and kept wanting to add juice and improve the game. I also chose to try and make my own music this time,
and messed around with Beepbox. I got one satisfactory song out of two hours, and decided I don't know enough
about music and composing to make songs for every aspect of the game. OpenGameArt saves the day yet again!

I struggled a lot with improving the movement of the frog. Studio Hungus's discussions stuck with me,
and I often found myself saying "Frogs dont *do* that." The balance between something that felt right to play
and looked frog-like. It was a bad struggle of changing out numbers and conditionals just to see what would work,
and as an end result I only somewhat understood what made the final product right. In the future, it would be 
a much better idea to clarify what I'm trying to make (and how and when it works) in english terms before jumping 
into making it work in code.
